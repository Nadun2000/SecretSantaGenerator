## ⚡ Secret Santa Random Selection Code ⚡

This Java program is designed to facilitate a Secret Santa event by randomly assigning participants as Secret Santas for one another. 
The code ensures that each participant is matched with another without duplicates or self-assignments, preserving the surprise and fairness of the event. 

## Features:
- Random Selection : Utilizes Java's Random class to ensure each selection is unbiased and unpredictable.
- No Self-Assignments : Implements logic to prevent participants from being assigned to themselves.
- Unique Pairings : Ensures that each participant is assigned exactly one recipient, with no duplicates.

## How It Works:
- Input : The program accepts a list of participant names.
- Shuffle : The list is shuffled to randomize the order.
- Assignment : Each participant is assigned the next name in the shuffled list, looping back to the start if necessary.

This simple yet effective approach guarantees a fun and equitable Secret Santa experience for all participants.
